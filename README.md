# SMInjector
This project is a tool that allows modders to create c++ addons for the game ScrapMechanic.

Inside the `PluginDevFolder` you will find examples of how to make plugins.


## Creating a plugin
To add a new plugin you can copy the settings from the `PluginDevFolder/SMPluginTemplate` project.
You need to place the compiled plugin into the `plugins` folder for it to be loaded by the injector.
